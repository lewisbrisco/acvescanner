# acvescanner
This project was created for my 4th year dissertation project for the degree of BSc Digital Security and Foresnics at Glasgow Caledonian University.

This tool primarily uses cve-bin-tool which can be found here, a thanks is also included in the program.

The main goal of this software is to provide an accessible, free peice of software for individuals and SME's to be able to easily and reliably scan their file systems for potential vulnerabilities.

Overall the hope is that acvescanner has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the digital security community, helping to increase awareness of potential vulnerabilities and improving the overall security of systems.
